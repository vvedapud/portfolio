		<p>Hi, I’m Vik! I love learning how people think and behave, and I utilize research to design user-center products and experiences to solve both user and business problems. My process is rooted in collaboration, curiosity, and innovation. Although I have a holistic view of user experience design, I am most focused on user research (persona creation, heuristic evaluation, usability testing), wireframing, and UI prototyping. In addition, I have experience with Python, Swift (iOS), and HTML/CSS. <br></br> I attend Michigan State University where I am studying Experience Architecture (XA). XA is cutting-edge degree program that aims to understand changing needs and shape new user experiences by bridging the gap between physical and digital ecosystems. This semester, I have joined the College of Arts and Letters (CAL) as a Web Development and Social Media Intern, as well as a member of the MSU VIM UX Team.
			<br></br>I transitioned into UX design at the start of 2020 because I had become frustrated at the lack of personality and consideration for a user’s experience in my engineering degree. My goal is to design products and experiences that are meaningful and impactful, and I’m especially interested in leveraging new technologies to improve people’s lives in innovative ways.
			<br></br>My past experience includes two summer internships at Ford Motor Company as a member of the Connected Vehicles Team. My duties included consolidating real-time trigger messages for the FordPass owner app, calling APIs using programs like Postman, and documenting user and client requirements. </p>
