Portfolio pages for HTML/CSS Assignment

I created my portfolio pages with the word "minimalism" in mind. I stayed away from bright, primary colors; and instead, used soft colors. 
I decided to implement my own version of a resume using HTML/CSS, and in the future, plan on attaching my real resume for employers to download.
I spent a lot of time on my About Page, really trying to tell my "story" as a UX designer. I talked about my interests, skills, and past experience. Using this, I can then show my ability to contribute to a new team!

At the last minute, my code got jumbled up, and I lost my logo. My next step would be to find the bug in my code and restore my original logo.
