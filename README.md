Portfolio pages for HTML/CSS Assignment

I created my portfolio pages with the word "minimalism" in mind. I stayed away from bright, primary colors; and instead, used soft colors. 
I decided to implement my own version of a resume using HTML/CSS, and in the future, plan on attaching my real resume for employers to download.

At the last minute, my code got jumbled up, and I lost my logo. My next step woould be to find the bug in my code and restore my original logo.
